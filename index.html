    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Runmila AI Institute is dedicated to preparing Ghana, and the rest of Africa for an Artificial 
    Intelligence (AI) Future and the 4th Industrial Revolution. The world is drastically changing 
    with all leading nations and blocs creating AI Plans & Strategies. Furthermore, plenty of 
    these leading nations and blocs have already started implementing these strategies; 
    Africa shouldn't be left behind. Through the skillful use of AI, we can leapfrog our
     development and solve many of Africa's grand challenges, especially connected to 
     the 'Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)'. Our goal is to train the talents that Africa
      requires to build this AI Future that the continent deserves and needs. We are doing this by equipping Africans, starting with Ghanaians, with practical 
       skills in AI (Deep Learning & Machine Learning) and Data Science. 
    </p><br>
    <h3>Course Design</h3>
    <p>Our courses are practical, being Development-focused and designed around 
    optimally teaching complex concepts in a fast and easy-to-grasp approach. 
    Our students take away skills to develop their own AI projects that
     they can readily implement for their needs and demonstrate to would-be
      investors or employers. These courses are crafted by Artificial Intelligence
       Engineers and Researchers who are already working on real world applications
        of Artificial Intelligence in Africa.</p>

       <h3>Our Founder</h3>
        <p>Darlington Ahiale Akogo is the Founder and Director of Runmila AI Institute, and the Founder, C.E.O and Director of Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://minohealth.com" target="_blank">minoHealth</a>, an Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Healthcare system for Medical Diagnostics and Evidence-based Healthcare. He's also an Advisory Board Member and Ambassador to West Africa
    at <a href="http://aiexpoafrica.com" target="_blank">AI Expo Africa</a>, the largest business focused AI community in Africa. Darlington Ahiale Akogo also heads
    minoHealth AI Labs where they research and apply Artificial
    Intelligence to fields like Biotechnology, Neuroscience, Optometry,
    Epidemiology, Dietetics/Nutrition and Agriculture. And with Gudra AI
    Studio, they explore Artificial Intelligence applied to general domains
    like Energy, Art, Education and Linguistics.<br><br> 
    Darlington Ahiale Akogo is also an Artificial Intelligence advocate, communicator and mentor. He
    believes Artificial Intelligence can solve a lot of problems plaguing Africa and being proactive is
    necessary in the Age of Artificial Intelligence and the 4th Industrial Revolution. So Darlington
    advocates, teaches and communicates Artificial Intelligence through seminars, lectures, interviews,
    writings and mentorships. He was a research presenter at NeurIPS 2018, the largest Conference on
    Artificial Intelligence in the World. And he was one of the speakers at the ​AI Expo Africa 2018 in
    Cape Town, South Africa and Next Einstein Forum’s ​<a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2018/september-11th/maiden-africa-science-week-ghana-celebration-set-for-sept-25.php" target="_blank">Africa Science Week</a>​. He was also a participant in
    Massachusett Institute of Technology (MIT)'s Global Community <a href="https://www.biosummit.org/darlington-akogo-2018/" target="_blank">​BioSummit</a> 2018. His research paper
    ‘ScaffoldNet: Detecting and Classifying Biomedical Polymer-Based Scaffolds via a Convolutional
    Neural Network’ has been accepted by the ​<a href="http://saiconference.com/FICC" target="_blank">Future of Information and Communications Conference​</a>,
    which is sponsored by IEEE  and featured in the book, ‘​<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-12385-7" target="_blank">​Advances in Information and Communication​</a>’. Alongside great minds including Yoshua Bengio, who's celebrated as one
    of the Fathers of Deep Learning, Darlington is featured in and wrote for the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H42MYMV" target="_blank">"​Artificial
    Intelligence Simplified​</a>: 99 Use Cases And Expert Thoughts For Starters" which was put together by
    Data Science Nigeria. He also writes reports and essays for ​<a href="https://issuu.com/aimediasynapse/docs/synapse_-_issue_1-opt" target="_blank">Synapse Magazine</a> - ‘The Voice of African
    Artificial Intelligence & Data Science’ by AI Media.</p>
